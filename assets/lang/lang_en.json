They are introduced into organizations to optimize and support operational and business processes, which in turn boosts competitiveness and productivity. These technologies generate information in conjunction with platforms designed to facilitate the development and dissemination of knowledge, considered a key resource for economic activities (Tello, 2007).",

These technologies generate information, along with platforms that support the development and dissemination of knowledge, an essential resource for economic activities (Tello, 2007).",
  "parrafo_0003": "Beyond the Internet, the infrastructure of many businesses has evolved toward digital, driven by the increasing intertwining of products, processes, and services. According to Bharadwaj et al. (2013, p. 471), digital technologies are 'fundamentally transforming business strategies, operational processes, enterprise capabilities, as well as products and services, and key relationships between firms in extended business networks.' For these authors, the role of ICT should be considered not only as a functional aspect of strategy, but aligned with the overall business strategy.",
  "parrafo_0004": "In this context, marketing is presented as an essential component of business strategy and has experienced rapid evolution in its application through the Internet and ICT (De Swaan Arons, Van den Driest and Weed, 2014).",
  "parrafo_0005": "Thus, digital marketing, also known as Internet marketing or electronic marketing, which refers to the use of ICT in marketing practice, becomes crucial for businesses, as it facilitates the approach to customers, allows them to understand them better, adds value to products, expands distribution channels and encourages increased sales (Chaffey and Smith, 2013).",

  "parrafo_0006": "In recent years, the theoretical concept of digital marketing has evolved comprehensively, exponentially, and also variably, with different types of digital marketing identified. Some organizations have worked on and communicated the need to achieve digital marketing without abandoning traditional marketing. Thus, business organizations are evolving their marketing strategies, especially as marketing usage and dynamism increase, creating challenges for those who lead or manage marketing departments. Furthermore, and in parallel, organizational strategic support has also evolved, and there are various types and methods for implementing it.",
  "parrafo_0007": "Digital Marketing encompasses all efforts to market our business's products or services online. Its main purpose is to connect with potential customers so that business objectives can be achieved.",
  "parrafo_0008": "Digital marketing uses various strategies to:",
  "parrafo_0009": "‚Ä¢ Connect with the potential client.",
  "parrafo_0010": "‚Ä¢ Attract him to the business.",
  "parrafo_0011": "‚Ä¢ Convert them into a prospect (lead); that is, a client who shows interest in the solutions you can offer.",
  "parrafo_0012": "‚Ä¢ Getting this potential client to become a real client.",
  "parrafo_0013": "‚Ä¢ Build loyalty in new customers so they become repeat customers, or recommend you to other potential customers.",
  "parrafo_0014": "In this sense, digital marketing and strategic support go hand in hand to achieve the objectives to be fulfilled by the different organizations, since any topic related to organizational administration or business management is open to all possibilities and strategies that are developed under this scheme, both concepts seeming inseparable and generating an important binomial between those who use them as cutting-edge administrative tools.",
  "parrafo_0015": "One of the definitions of marketing that best fits current realities would be that of Monroy (2014), which states that marketing seeks to understand the market and all the needs and desires that may exist, so that through the development of plans and strategies with a logical sequence, not only are these needs met, but a value greater than expected is also delivered, allowing for the creation of profitable relationships with which, in return, sales items, profits and long-term customer value are obtained.",
  "parrafo_0016": "This definition is complemented very well by Lovett (2012), who explains that these desires are established by the society in which we live and the environment in which we develop and operate; that is, they are shaped by consumer culture. When these desires are within our economic reach, we can say that they become demands, which ultimately become the determining component of any company's revenue projection, since their profits are derived from them.",
  "parrafo_0017": "To complement the previous definitions, Pressman (2005) is cited, who states that any element of marketing must be focused on the customer, in devising different ways to win them over, retain them and gain their loyalty by delivering superior value in the products and services offered.",
  "parrafo_0018": "However, before these processes can be implemented, it is first necessary to understand how their needs and desires manifest themselves, and this requires a meticulous analysis of these factors. In marketing, there are forces that affect a company's behavior and can work against or in its favor. These forces require constant monitoring and control to prevent them from affecting the company's ability to serve its customers, with the goal of developing relationships that remain stable over the long term.",
  "parrafo_0019": "For all these reasons, a marketing manager must be attentive to the inherent changes in production systems, and regarding the profile of this person, the magazine Marketing Digital (2019) states that the marketing manager is someone who understands the masses and knows how to lead them, in order to work towards the efficient fulfillment of a task or goal. This is a professional with charisma in their personality, and who is additionally consistent in their actions and words, which is why they inspire security in their team. This is why these people become authentic leaders in their environments, companies and work teams, understanding this concept from the perspective of Fisher, Sharp & Richardson (1998), which coincides with Chiavenato (2007), Earls & Forsyth (1991), Hersey et al. (1998) and P√©rez-L√≥pez (1998) and Rodr√≠guez-Ponce et al. (2016), in their view that the actions of leaders are normally reflected in the actions they perform in their companies and in social life itself, through external behaviors, the way they see life, the way they interact, and a series of congenital variables that in turn make them different from one another. It is also important to emphasize the need for these leaders to have highly developed competencies related to emotional intelligence, as pointed out by Goleman (2015) and Maxwell (2007).",
  "parrafo_0020": "In this regard, Robles-Francia et al. (2013) conclude that a charismatic marketing manager has a more affective, effective and efficient influence on the company in question, and that this is the driving force behind its development, arguing that ‚Äúin order to predict which style of behavior will be more efficient, it is necessary to know the most relevant facets of the situation where digital marketing occurs. These approaches emphasize the importance of contextual factors, such as the nature of the task, the availability of human and material resources, organizational characteristics and the attributes of subordinates. They are theories based on the assumption that different behaviors and styles are effective under different situational conditions, and that there is no single, optimal behavior for all situations.‚Äù",
  "parrafo_0021": "CURRENT SITUATION OF THE DIGITAL MARKET",
  "parrafo_0022": "There are approximately 3.8 billion active social media users. Social media advertising spending increased by almost 30% in 2021 compared to 2020. Instagram helps at least 80% of its users make the decision to purchase a product or service. TikTok was the most downloaded app in the world in March 2021, with more than 115 million downloads. Around 75% of millennials watch videos on social media daily. Year after year, smartphones are consolidating as the devices of choice for searches, while desktop computers are increasingly falling in preference for performing this type of action. At least 28% of people who search for a local business through their smartphones make a purchase. When it comes to influencer marketing, micro-influencers are gaining increasing prominence.",
  "parrafo_0023": "During the third quarter of 2020, compared to the third quarter of 2019, the number of influencers using the #ad hashtag in their posts increased by 10.6%. Videos are the most used tool in content marketing, followed by blogs and infographics.",
  "parrafo_0024": "Globally, 70% of marketing professionals actively invest in content marketing. In Latin America, the percentage drops to 50%. However, the trend in the region is to invest increasingly in this type of marketing.",
  "parrafo_0025": "Today, despite the fact that we've been immersed in a digital world for several years, many companies still don't take full advantage of all the potential benefits this situation offers. Therefore, those who do can significantly advance their competitors.",

  "parrafo_0037": "The digital consumer is a very demanding shopper who seeks more than just products. They want to buy experiences and feel unique and special. Therefore, brands face a very important challenge: satisfying consumers who are highly impacted by different digital channels with endless offers that aim to capture their attention and touch their emotions with unique advertising and very special experiences. Thus, brands today must seek out their best appeal and offer their customers something unique that will keep them coming back. Furthermore, these profiles highly value immediacy and, therefore, generally lack patience.",
  "parrafo_0038": "Therefore, there is no such thing as a digital consumer profile; rather, companies must differentiate between the characteristics of each to determine which one to focus on more closely. Consumers are divided based on their interest in a particular product or service. In this way, we will differentiate between the different consumers that exist in the digital age so you can understand the specific characteristics of each and how best to impact them, based on their characteristics.",

  "parrafo_0049": "These are those who request information and look for opportunities to find specific products. Thus, this isn't a profile interested in new content, but rather one seeking opinions and comments from consumers who have already purchased the product.",
  "parrafo_0050": "Let's say this type of digital consumer is pretty clear about what they want; they just need to decide where to buy it. They tend to be quite quick and impatient because they're very clear about wanting a product as soon as possible. If they don't love it, they'll abandon the website and look for the same product on a competitor's website.",
  "parrafo_0051": "Enthusiastic consumers:",
  "parrafo_0052": "These are those who seek to connect with people who share their interests. These are young people who value brands that try to connect with them and reach their emotions. Due to their age, they are very active consumers on social media, where brands undoubtedly need to be present to reach them. Recently, new platforms have emerged where Generation Z has a significant presence, such as TikTok and the recently created social network, Be Real.",
  "parrafo_0053": "Trusted consumers:",
  "parrafo_0054": "In this case, we're talking about consumers who have a close relationship with their family and friends‚Äîthat is, their inner circle.

  "parrafo_0137": "From the convenience of shopping from home to the wide variety of products available, the advantages of e-commerce are undeniable. In this section, we'll explore in detail how e-commerce has transformed the shopping experience and provided benefits to both businesses and consumers.",
  "parrafo_0137_1": "1. Convenience and accessibility: One of the most obvious advantages of e-commerce is the convenience it offers consumers. With just a few clicks, users can access a wide range of products and services from the comfort of their homes or mobile devices. This accessibility eliminates geographic and time restrictions, allowing transactions to be conducted anytime, anywhere.",
  "parrafo_0137_2": "2. Scalability and Expansion: E-commerce provides businesses with the ability to expand their reach and grow scalably without the need to invest in expensive physical infrastructure. Through online platforms, companies can reach a global audience, overcoming geographical limitations and maximizing their growth potential.",
  "parrafo_0137_3": "3. Personalization and Segmentation: The ability to personalize the customer experience is one of the key advantages of e-commerce. Companies can use behavioral and preference data to offer tailored recommendations and promotions, increasing the relevance and effectiveness of their marketing strategies.",
  "parrafo_0137_4": "4. Operational efficiency: E-commerce allows businesses to automate processes and reduce operating costs. From inventory management to payment processing, automating routine tasks streamlines business operations and improves overall efficiency.",
  "parrafo_0137_5": "5. Greater geographic reach: Unlike physical stores, which are limited by their geographic location, e-commerce offers businesses the opportunity to reach customers worldwide. This ability to reach new markets expands growth potential and increases revenue diversification.",
  "parrafo_0137_6": "6. Data analytics to improve customer experience: E-commerce provides a wealth of data on customer behavior and preferences. Businesses can use data analytics to better understand their audience, identify purchasing trends, and continuously improve the customer experience.",
  "parrafo_0138": "Disadvantages of e-commerce",
  "parrafo_0139": "Despite its numerous advantages, e-commerce also faces a number of challenges that must be addressed. From security concerns to the lack of human contact, these disadvantages raise questions about e-commerce.",
  "parrafo_0139_1": "1. Lack of human contact: Unlike in-person transactions, e-commerce lacks direct human interaction between seller and customer. This lack of contact can make it difficult to build strong customer relationships and limit the ability to provide personalized service.",
  "parrafo_0139_2": "2. Security concerns: As online transactions increase, so do concerns about data security and privacy. Consumers fear the theft of personal and financial information, which can undermine their trust in e-commerce platforms and reduce their propensity to shop online.",
  "parrafo_0139_3": "3. Intense Competition: E-commerce has democratized market access, meaning barriers to entry are lower than ever. This has led to market saturation and fierce competition between companies, making it difficult for businesses to stand out and capture consumers' attention.",
  "parrafo_0139_4": "4. Shipping and return costs: Despite the convenience, shipping and return costs can discourage consumers from shopping online. High shipping costs and complicated return policies can affect customer satisfaction and decrease conversion rates.",
  "parrafo_0139_5": "5. Connectivity Dependence: E-commerce relies heavily on internet connectivity, which can be a challenge in areas with limited infrastructure or unstable connections. Lack of reliable internet access can limit businesses' reach and negatively impact customer experience.",
  "parrafo_0140": "Difference between e-commerce and e-business",
  "parrafo_0141": "E-business refers to digitally enabled transactions and processes within an organization, involving information systems under the organization's control. Additionally, e-business does not include commercial transactions that involve an exchange of value across organizational boundaries.",
  "parrafo_0142": "For example, an organization's online inventory control mechanism is a component of e-business, but such internal processes do not directly generate revenue for the organization (Laudon and Guercio Traver, 2017).",
  "parrafo_0143": "According to this, e-commerce consists of commercial transactions conducted over the Internet, while e-business uses information technology and information systems, seeking to improve processes and transactions within organizations. However, it should be noted that an organization's technological infrastructure is fundamental to both e-commerce and e-business.",
  "parrafo_0144": "Unique features of e-commerce",
  "parrafo_0145": "UBIQUITY. ",
  "parrafo_0145_1": "It refers to the fact that e-commerce is available anywhere and at any time of day, allowing consumers to purchase from a computer, a mobile device, at home, in their car, or wherever they happen to be. The result of this is a market space.",
  "parrafo_0146": "That is, the traditional boundaries of space and time are transcended. Ubiquity, therefore, reduces transaction costs and cognitive energy (Laudon and Guercio Traver, 2017).",
  "parrafo_0147": "GLOBAL REACH ",
  "parrafo_0147_1": "E-commerce technology enables commercial transactions across regional, national, and cultural boundaries. The potential market size for e-commerce is equal to the size of the global online population (Laudon and Guercio Traver, 2017).",
  "parrafo_0148": "UNIVERSAL STANDARDS: ",
  "parrafo_0148_1": "A striking feature of e-commerce is that the technical standards of the Internet, and therefore the technical standards used in e-commerce, are universal standards shared by all nations around the world. These standards have no cost; they simply need to be met. Therefore, market entry costs are lower, as are search costs. This allows for price discovery and network externalities (Laudon and Guercio Traver, 2017).",
  "parrafo_0149": "WEALTH. ",
  "parrafo_0149_1": "E-commerce has the potential to offer richer information because it allows for interactivity and tailors messages to the user's needs. An example of this is the role of virtual advisors.",
  "parrafo_0149_2": "Additionally, wealth enables the sale of more complex services and goods, which previously required face-to-face contact (such as financial and tourism services, for example) (Laudon and Guercio Traver, 2017).",
  "parrafo_0150": "INTERACTIVITY. ",
  "parrafo_0150_1": "Websites offer consumers spaces such as forums and social media platforms for sharing experiences with the services and products offered. This is the case with Like and Share buttons, which provide consumers with the opportunity to interact with the business and other consumers (Laudon and Guercio Traver, 2017).",
  "parrafo_0151": "PERSONALIZATION. ",
  "parrafo_0151_1": "In e-commerce, personalization can be viewed from two perspectives. The first is the targeting of marketing messages according to consumers' needs, interests, and previous purchases. The second perspective is the consumer's ability to personalize the product or service based on their preferences (Laudon and Guercio Traver, 2017).",
  "parrafo_0152": "SOCIAL TECHNOLOGY ",
  "parrafo_0152_1": "E-commerce allows users to create and share content with the web community. Using these forms of communication, users are able to create new social networks and strengthen existing ones (Laudon and Guercio Traver, 2017).",
  "parrafo_0152_2": "These spaces benefit organizations because they allow for interaction between them and consumers, allowing them to gain insights into their opinions and suggestions, which the organization can then use to improve and innovate products and services, among other things.",
  "parrafo_0153": "Types of e-commerce",
  "parrafo_0154": "E-commerce can take many forms depending on the degree of digitalization of the product, the purchase/sale process, and delivery. When the product, the purchase/sale process, and delivery are digital, it is referred to as pure e-commerce (Turban and Volonino, 2010). An example of pure e-commerce would be purchasing an e-book, paying electronically and generating a download link.",
  "parrafo_0155": "Partial e-commerce is when the product, the purchase/sale process, or the delivery process are not digital. For example, when a shirt is purchased from an online store, payment is made digitally, and delivery is via a shipping company. This is a clear example that illustrates that not the entire process is entirely digital.",
